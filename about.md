I'm RFX. I work as a Sysadmin and I like doing an unusual amount of different things.

Some of the things I like are:
- Programming
- Visual Novels
- Retro Computing
- 3D Printing
- Music Production
- Electronics
- Video Games

This is by no means a comprehensive list, but you can expect to read stuff about those topics on here.
